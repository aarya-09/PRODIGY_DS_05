# PRODIGY_DS_05
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
# Accident Data Analysis

This Python script analyzes accident data using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. It visualizes the distribution of accidents across states, accidents based on road conditions, timing of accidents, accidents by weather conditions and timing of the day, and reasons for accidents. Additionally, it provides insights into the total deaths based on state and timing.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:git clone <repository_url>
2. Install the required libraries:pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib

## Usage

1. Download the `accidents.csv` dataset.
2. Place the dataset in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script.

The script will read the dataset, perform analysis, and generate visualizations based on different aspects of the accident data.

## Overview of Visualizations

1. Distribution of Accidents Across States
2. Accidents Based on Road Conditions
3. Accidents Based on Timing of the Day
4. Accidents by Weather Conditions and Timing of the Day
5. Reason for Accidents
6. Death Timing Ratio by State

## File Description

- `accidents.csv`: Dataset containing information about accidents.

## Acknowledgments

- The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [provide the source if available].
- This script is for educational purposes and serves as a demonstration of data analysis techniques using Python.
